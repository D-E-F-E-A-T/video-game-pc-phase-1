Gameplay Notes

In the overworld, only allow moving to the next screen if player is on the path.
For example, if the player burns all the trees in the corner of the screen,
and the player attemps to move to the corner, then scrolling to the next screen is not possible.

Have exit squares to mark the North, East, South, and West squares for each screen.

Shovels for digging in the dirt.
