# Simple Game Engine for 2D, Overhead-View, Role-Playing Games, in C++ and DirectX
This project implements a simple game engine for 2D, overhead-view, role-playing games.  The engine is written in C++ and DirectX.

At its completion, this project will be able to serve as a starter kit for anyone that would like to create their PC games.  While there exist out-of-the-box game engines such as Unity that can be used to create games more quickly, the purpose here is to create an example from scratch using C++ and DirectX.
