# Simple Game Engine for 2D, Overhead-View, Role-Playing Games, in C++ and DirectX
This project implements a simple game engine for 2D, overhead-view, role-playing games.  The engine is written in C++ and DirectX.

At its completion, this project will be able to serve as a starter kit for anyone that would like to create their own simple PC games.  

While there exist out-of-the-box game engines such as Unity, Unreal, and Torque that can be used to create games more quickly, the purpose here is to create a pedagogical example from scratch using nothing more than C++ and DirectX 11.
