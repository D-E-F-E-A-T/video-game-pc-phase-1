# The Game Project, Phase 1
# Simple Game Engine for 2D, Overhead-View, Role-Playing Games, in C++ and DirectX
This project implements a simple game engine for 2D, overhead-view, role-playing games of the ilk of the original classic "The Legend of Zelda."

At its completion, this project could serve as a starter kit for students, hobbyists, and others interested in learning how to create their own simple, RPG, PC games.  

While advanced and mature out-of-the-box game engines such as Unity, Unreal, and Torque that can be used to create 3D games much more quickly, the purpose here is to create a pedagogical example from scratch using nothing more than C++ and DirectX 11.

The starting point for this project was the Direct 3D Sprite example: (https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Direct3D-sprite-sample-97ae6262/view/SourceCode#content
